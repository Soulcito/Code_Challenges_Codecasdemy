#Find the next palindrome

A palindrome is a whole number that is the same when read backwards and forwards, for example: 12321, 141 or 10001. The challenge is to write a program (in a language of your choice) that will return the next palindrome for a given integer.

For example:
nextPalindrome(808) // 818
nextPalindrome(999) // 1001
nextPalindrome(2133) // 2222

Note: Try to make a solution that is more efficient than incrementing and checking each subsequent number to see if it's a palindrome. While this would technically work, it would perform rather slowly for very large inputs.
